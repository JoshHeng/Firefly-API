# Welcome to the unofficial Firefly API
[Firefly](https://www.fireflylearning.com) is a virtual learning environment for schools. We have monitored the API requests made by the mobile app to construct this repository.

This repository provides example code in Node.JS. You will also need to install the needed modules and libraries using `npm install`.
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/JoshHeng/Firefly-API/wiki) for detailed information about the API.
